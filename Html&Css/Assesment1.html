old off-roader to a versatile
and modern SUV that can take you anywhere in comfort.
Available with multiple drivetrain options
and many variants, the Thar offers loads of 
road presence and strong performance both on and off
the road. However, its two-door configuration puts a 
small dent on the practicality front.<pre>
